Human activities release traces of their passage into the environment. In this regard, we often think of air or water pollution, but usually, little attention is paid to light pollution. Namely, the light emitted by human economic activities that has characterised our economic production since the second industrial revolution.

Most human economic activities produce light. For instance, using a car to drive to work or to visit a tourist destination produces light pollution. Similarly, building a bridge, skyscraper, or airport increases the amount of light emitted.

For many years, measuring light sources' intensity was impossible, especially with proper space geolocalisation. However, the relatively recent production of specialised satellite modules permitted effectively measuring the spatial distribution and reflectance intensity of such light sources with high frequency and geospatial accuracy.

This thesis aims to study the relationship between economic activity and light pollution production using the satellite images that NASA and the Earth Observation Group (EOG) of the Colorado School of Mines release publicly. In particular, I will devote several pages to studying the relationship between night-time lights and GDP, their causal link and the many economic applications. I will show the intriguing properties that satellite surveys have in estimating economic variables, such as their almost global coverage, their exogenous nature and the high frequency of the data. 

As per past literature, night-time lights are strongly correlated with some economic measures. However, handling such data is not straightforward, and the relationship between the two is not linear but changes over time. Moreover, I will show that this relation depends on the characteristics of the countries, on their share of agriculture in the economical production and on the level of economic development in the region.

The Defence Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) is a US military programme that, since the 1960s, has been involved in the launch into orbit of satellites to acquire environmental earth data. The project is jointly managed by the United States Space Force and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
For ten years, i.e. from the 1960s until 1972, the operation remained highly classified due to the very high technology involved. Moreover, the tense period of the Cold War certainly played an important role as the DMSP satellites collected photographs twice a day for each area of the world.
As of December 1972, the mission was declassified and began to be opened to the civil scientific community.

The DMSP-OLS satellite was equipped with special sensors capable of measuring visible and near-infrared light day and night. The collected images were used to observe meteorological systems and cloud coverage. 
While recognising cloud bodies from daytime images was quite simple, doing so with night-time images entailed many more complications. Therefore, the sensor was upgraded with a 'Photomultiplier Tube' (PMT) capable of enhancing the light captured by the sensor, thus producing images of the globe of night lights. From the comparison of the images of different times, and thus, from the presence or absence of light pixels attesting, as mentioned, human settlements, it could be stated that this area was covered or not by clouds.

In this thesis, I will only use the data from the night measurement. Such images are much easier to study in the economic analysis without losing the instrument's effectiveness. Namely, there is no need to analyse complex images of the earth's surface during the day when it is sufficient to analyse night-time light sources. Furthermore, night-time data do not suffer from the intense light distortions caused by the sun.

Since the night light monitoring system has been operating, DMSP sensors have been the leading technology adopted. However, the data produced by DMSP has some limitations due to the outdated technology. Namely poor resolution, six-bit quantisation, saturation on the brightest lights, lack of in-flight calibration, and production of files with a lack of spectral layers suitable for discriminating different light sources.

A significant advance in this technology was achieved when the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) was launched into orbit in October 2011 by the Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP). The new type of sensor mounted on the satellite has overcome many of the problems of the old generation. Compared with DMSP-OLS night-time light data, imagery obtained by NPP-VIIRS possesses finer spatial resolution (742 * 742 m vs. 5km * 5km at nadir) and higher radiometric resolution (quantisation of 14 bits vs. 6 bits). Moreover, an onboard calibration system has been implemented to enhance the quality of NPP-VIIRS night-time data.
